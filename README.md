## ⚙️ Easy Installation
- Install .EXE from Release

> **Tip:** On first launch, right-click → "Run as administrator" so that auto-restart and firewall rule management work without interruption.

---

## 📋 RCON Setup

To use RCON, your `<ServerRoot>\battleye\BEServer_x64.cfg` must contain:

```
RConPassword YourPasswordHere
RConPort 2305
```

The default RCON port is **game port + 3** (e.g. 2302 → 2306).

---

## 🎯 Generated start.bat format

The app generates a clean, readable one-shot launcher:

```batch
@echo off
title DayZ Server MyServer

set mods=@CF;@DabsFramework;@DayZ-Expansion-Core
set servermods=@AutoStack;@DynamicAI

echo =====================================
echo  Starting DayZ Server: MyServer
echo =====================================
echo.

start "" "C:\dayzserver\DayZServer_x64.exe" ^
    -config=serverDZ.cfg ^
    -port=2302 ^
    -profiles=profiles ^
    -name=MyServer ^
    -mod=%mods% ^
    -servermod=%servermods% ^
    -dologs ^
    -adminlog ^
    -netlog ^
    -freezecheck ^
    -BEPath="C:\dayzserver\battleye"
```

No restart loop — restarts are managed by the app. The `.bat` is a clean one-shot launcher.
